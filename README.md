# Enhance-Pipelined-AF
Configurable Activation Function using enhance pipeline stages CORDIC architecture

Three experiment is done for CORDIC based activation function validation using MNIST datasets.
1) Accuracy vs data-bit precision 
2) Accuracy vs # of CORDIC iterations
3) Accuracy vs dynamic fixed point representation with variable binary point implication 

Fully connected neural network (784:256:128:128:10) is used for the test accuracy validation.
